    {"role": "user", "content": "In mathematics, a fractal is a geometric shape containing detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales, usually having a fractal dimension strictly exceeding the topological dimension. Many fractals appear similar at various scales, as illustrated in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. This exhibition of similar patterns at increasingly smaller scales is called self-similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry; if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge, the shape is called affine self-similar. Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of measure theory."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In mathematics, a fractal is a type of geometry comprised of intricate and repeating small-scale shapes. This phenomenon is known as self-similarity or expanding symmetry, and occurs as the shape emerges at varying magnifications. Popular examples of fractals include the Mandelbrot set and the Menger sponge. As a well-defined mathematical concept with roots in measure theory, fractal geometry has been studied extensively by mathematicians and scientists alike."}
