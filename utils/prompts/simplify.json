    {"role": "user", "content": "In mathematics, a fractal is a geometric shape containing detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales, usually having a fractal dimension strictly exceeding the topological dimension. Many fractals appear similar at various scales, as illustrated in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. This exhibition of similar patterns at increasingly smaller scales is called self-similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry; if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge, the shape is called affine self-similar. Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of measure theory."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "A fractal is a shape that has a lot of detail, no matter how much you zoom in. It has a special property called self-similarity, which means that it looks similar at different scales. Some fractals, like the Mandelbrot set, have this property at infinitely small scales. Fractals can have a dimension that is not a whole number, and they are studied in a branch of math called measure theory."}
